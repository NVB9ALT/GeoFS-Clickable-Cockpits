This addon adds the ability to click on and interact with certain parts of the cockpit on a few official GeoFS aircraft. A full list is below.<br>
**This is a bookmarklet addon. Here's how to run it:**

- Click the little star icon at the right end of your search bar to make a bookmark
- Click "more"
- Type "GeoFS Clickable Cockpits" in the "Name" box
- Paste the code into the "URL" space
- Click "save"
- Click the bookmark when running GeoFS to run it.


*HOW TO USE:*<br>
For throttles, click on the throttle and hold until the throttle is at the desired position. At the max and idle settings, a detent keeps the lever in position for half a second so that setting max or idle thrust is slightly easier.<br>
For anything else, click and hold for half a second. Try not to click and hold for more than half a second, because that would trigger the switch twice.
